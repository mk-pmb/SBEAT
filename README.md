SBEAT: a classic MacOS 9 app of breeding tool for musical composition developed by T. Unemi in 2001.
--------
This archive contains source codes of SBEAT 3.2b1 developed by
Tatsuo Unemi in 2003 using a classic programming tool
"CodeWarrior" on MacOS 9 and the Classic environment on MacOS X.

Because the programming environment has been unavailable on
recent machines and the binary code cannot run on MacOS X
without Rosetta PPC emulator, the author has given up to
continue maintaining this software anymore.

The author would be happy if anybody could rebuilt it to be
runnable on newer systems, or even could be inspired his/her
own idea from these codes.

Any comments and suggestions are welcome.
